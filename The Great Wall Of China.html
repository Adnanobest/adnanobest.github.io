      <h2 style="color: goldenrod;">Interesting Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b style="color: red;">Length and Engineering Marvel</b>: The Great Wall is the longest man-made structure
          in
          the world, stretching approximately 21,196.18 kilometers (13,170.70 miles).
          It's equivalent to half the length of the Equator!
          The main part of the wall, built during the Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644), spans 8,851.8 kilometers (5,500
          miles).
          The average height of the walls is 6 to 7 meters (20 to 23 feet), with the highest point reaching 14 meters
          (46
          feet).
          The Great Wall varies in altitude, from the 1,439.3-meter (4,722 feet) peak at Huanglouyuan near Beijing to
          the
          sea level at Laolongtou in Hebei. Its average width is 6.5 meters (21.3 feet).</li>
        <li><b style="color: red;">Ancient Origins</b>: The initial construction of the Great Wall began 2,700 years ago
          during the Spring and Autumn Period (770 - 276 BC). The earliest fortifications were built by the Chu State
          during the 7th century BC. The last construction occurred in 1878 during the late Qing Dynasty.</li>
        <li><b style="color: red;">Not One Consistent Wall</b>: Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall is not a
          single
          continuous line.
          It's a collection of walls and forts, built in different historical periods.
          Some segments run parallel, while others scatter across the landscape.
          The structure is a defensive network rather than a single long line.</li>
        <li><b style="color: red;">UNESCO World Heritage Site</b>: The Great Wall is a symbol of China and a UNESCO
          World
          Heritage Site. It embodies human ingenuity, determination, and the desire to protect one's homeland.</li>
        <li><b style="color: red;">Myths and Legends</b>: Legends say that the wall is visible from space, but this is a
          myth. The Great Wall was not built by a single emperor; it evolved over centuries. It served as a cultural and
          economic exchange route, not just a military defense.</li>
      </ul>

    <p><i>These sections showcase the Great Wall's diverse character, from restored elegance to rugged wilderness. Each
        has its own allure, making the Great Wall an unforgettable journey through history and natural beauty.</i></p>
