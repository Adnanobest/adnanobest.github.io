            <ul>
                <li><b style="color: red;">Construction and Builders</b>: The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, was built
                    between 72 AD and 80 AD under the Emperor Vespasian. Construction was completed by Vespasian's sons,
                    Emperors Titus and Domitian. An estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Jewish slaves were employed in its
                    construction. The Colosseum stands as a testament to Roman engineering and craftsmanship.</li>
                <li><b style="color: forestgreen;">Name Origins</b>: Originally called the Flavian Amphitheatre, it was later named the Colosseum.
                    The name likely comes from the colossal bronze statue of Emperor Nero that once stood nearby. This
                    statue was modeled after the <b style="color: red;">Colossus of Rhodes.</b></li>
                <li><b style="color: forestgreen;">Impressive Dimensions</b>: The Colosseum is oval-shaped, measuring 189 meters long, 156 meters
                    wide, and 48.5 meters tall. Its entire surface area covers 6 acres. The outer walls feature 80
                    arches, with 76 numbered in Roman numerals for seating guidance.</li>
                <li><b style="color: red;">Innovative Features</b>: The Colosseum could simulate water battles. Its intricate plumbing
                    system allowed for flooding the arena to simulate ocean scenes. It has experienced large fires and
                    earthquakes throughout its history, leading to multiple repairs and reconstructions.</li>
